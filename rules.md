In the genre of MtG, Hearthstone, Kard Combat, etc.



It’s a two player game but designed to be asymmetric: one human player, one automatic boss. No randomness, no hidden information.



Setup:

Boss health

Target rounds

Boss cards (played)

Player mana per round

Player hand



Goal: remove all health from the boss in the target number of rounds.



Cards have the following types:

Creatures

Spells

Effects

Mods (applied to creatures)



All cards cost an amount of mana to cast. Creatures are placed left to right.



Creatures have a power stat. They may attack once in a round then become tired for that round. A creature attacks another creature if the boss has any out. Otherwise it attacks the boss directly, doing damage equal to its power. If a creature fights another creature, the power is subtracted from both sides. If zero or less, the creature dies.



Spells do instant things like damage the boss or make a creature not tired. Some have targets.



Effects stay on the battlefield indefinitely. For example, a War Banner effect gives all player creatures +1 power while attacking.



Mods attach to any creature (player or boss) and permanently modify it, such as granting Pierce or a damage shield.


Testudo: if a creature with Testudo has friendly creatures on both sides of it on the board, it takes no combat damage (attacking or defending).


Venom: when a creature with Venom attacks, it gives the target a poison token.


Poison: each poison token deals 1 damage at the end of every round.



At the end of the round any creature that is tired becomes rested. The player gets more mana according to the setup. (Mana carries over).



Players can do any number of actions in a round in any order until they choose to end the round.
